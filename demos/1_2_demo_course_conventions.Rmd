```{r setup1, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      fig.width = 5, 
                      fig.height = 3,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      message = FALSE,
                      error = FALSE)
```

```{r, root_1, include=FALSE}
## defines the root of the project for later use
require("rprojroot") || utils::install.packages("rprojroot")
library(rprojroot)
root <- find_root_file(criterion = is_rstudio_project)
```

## Packages
```{r}
library(usethis)
library(devtools)
library(gapminder)
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Code Style

 * The slides in the course contain a number of style and syntax conventions.
 * Code styles and syntax can vary
 * Be consistent

## Capitals vs lower case

 * Everything in lower case
 * I use `snake_case`
 * Many people use `camelCase`

```{r}
gapminder %>% names
flights %>% names
```

## Printing a tbl_df
```{r}
table <- tibble("a_is_a_variable" = c(1:5), "b_is_another_variable" = rnorm(5))
table
```

## Variables

 * All lower case
 * Don't use capitals and special characters in file names

"`excel_file_of_important_dataset.xlsx`"

DON'T: "`data file + version 12_11_2017%.xlsx`"

## Packages referrals

Names of R packages are indicated as:

 * mostly: `{dplyr}`
 * sometimes: {dplyr}
 * not often: "dplyr"

## Explicit functions

When we want to be explicit about a certain function in a package:

`dplyr::filter()`

Refers to the `filter()` function in the package `{dplyr}`

## Loose code in the slides
Sometimes a few lines of codes are displayed for demo purpose:

`four_numbers <- c(1:4)`

`multiply <- 4*four_numbers`

`sum(multiply^2)`

## Code blocks

Code blocks in slides are indicated as below:
The result of the code is usually also displayed
```{r, fig.height=2, fig.width=3}
set.seed(1234)
code_that_does_something <- rnorm(1000)
hist(code_that_does_something, main = "rnorm")
```

## Hiding code 

Sometimes it makes sense to hide the code and only display the result. 
This can be done by setting the code chunk options `echo = FALSE`

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=3}
set.seed(1234)
code_that_does_something <- rnorm(1000)
hist(code_that_does_something, main = "rnorm")
```

## Other important chunk options

 * Like hiding the code, we can hide the result of that code and only display the code by setting `results = "hide"`
 * Setting `eval = FALSE` means the chunk is not included in the slide show at all
 * Setting `include = FALSE` means the chunk is run and the results are evaluated, but both the code and the results are not included in the slide-show/document 
 * Controlling settings for the complete document can be done in the `setup*` chunk that you will find in all Rmarkdown files from the course

```{r, setup2, eval = FALSE}
 knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                       message = FALSE,
                       warning = FALSE,
                       error = TRUE,
                       fig.width = 5, fig.height = 3)
```
 
 * There are many chunk options. Some we will see in later lessons

## Replacing old, creating new variables
```{r, eval=FALSE}
## replacing lifeExp in years for lifeExp in months
gapminder$lifeExp <- (gapminder$lifeExp*24)

## instead create a new variable in the dataframe
gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(lifeExp_months = lifeExp * 24)
```

_Mutate new variables on the basis of old one, do not replace the old variable_

## R packages

 * R packages are self-contained pieces of R code that allow easy sharing of R implementations
 * They follow a strict structure
 * They allow for versioning
 * The can be tested (unit tests)
 * They can be distributed (CRAN, Bioconductor, Github, Bitbucket, ...)
 * They can be made to fit multiple Operating Sytems
 
## There are many R packages

```{r, r_packages_graph, echo=FALSE}
source(here::here("/code/r_packages_graph.R"))
```
 
## Building an R package
During the course we will gradually build our own R package as a demonstration that it is actually not so difficult as it sounds.

## Initiate a package
Initiate a package skeleton with the following command:
```{r, eval=FALSE}  
library(usethis)
usethis::create_package(path = file.path("../courser"))
```
A new RStudio Project Session will open and will provide you with a skeleton of a new package called "courser". 

## Adding content to the package

As the course continues we will start filling this package skeleton with functions and data.

We will take three more steps to start with our package:

## 1. Package description
Look at the file named "DESCRIPTION". Provide some basic            information about yourself and what the package is intended for. Fill  in the fields:

  - `Title`; Provide a short description
  - `Authors@R`; provide your name and email-address (if you want)
  Leave the rest unchanged

## 2. Add a package dependency
Let's add our first dependency. The first dependecy that we will add is a package that we will use for data manipulation. It is called `{dplyr}` and we will use it very often. It makes sense to add this package as a dependency to our own package. The following code does that
```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_package(package = "dplyr")
```
 
## 3. Building a package
To build the package
run 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::document(pkg = file.path("../courser"))
```
Than run:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
system("R CMD INSTALL --preclean --no-multiarch --with-keep.source ../courser")
```

## **CONGRATULATIONS!!** 

You have juist build your own R package. We can now start adding functionality to it. We will do so as the course progresses.
